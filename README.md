## Overview
This project involves analyzing a Spotify dataset with various attributes about tracks, albums, and artists using SQL. It covers an end-to-end process of normalizing a denormalized dataset, performing SQL queries of varying complexity (easy, medium, and advanced), and optimizing query performance. The primary goals of the project are to practice advanced SQL skills and generate valuable insights from the dataset.

## Table Creation
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS spotify_;
CREATE TABLE spotify_ (
    artist VARCHAR(255),
    track VARCHAR(255),
    album VARCHAR(255),
    album_type VARCHAR(50),
    danceability FLOAT,
    energy FLOAT,
    loudness FLOAT,
    speechiness FLOAT,
    acousticness FLOAT,
    instrumentalness FLOAT,
    liveness FLOAT,
    valence FLOAT,
    tempo FLOAT,
    duration_min FLOAT,
    title VARCHAR(255),
    channel VARCHAR(255),
    views FLOAT,
    likes BIGINT,
    comments BIGINT,
    licensed VARCHAR(5),
    official_video VARCHAR(5),
    stream BIGINT,
    energy_liveness FLOAT,
    most_played_on VARCHAR(50)
);
```

## Project Steps
### 1. Data Exploration
Before diving into SQL, itâ€™s important to understand the dataset thoroughly. The dataset contains attributes such as:
- **Artist**: The performer of the track.
- **Track**: The name of the song.
- **Album**: The album to which the track belongs.
- **Album Type**: The type of album (e.g., single or album).
- Various metrics such as danceability, energy, loudness, tempo, and more.

### 2. Importing the Dataset
```sql
-- Check the secure-file-priv Setting
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'secure_file_priv';

-- Importing the dataset after moving to the correct directory path
LOAD DATA INFILE "C:/ProgramData/MySQL/MySQL Server 8.0/Uploads/cleaned_dataset.csv"
INTO TABLE spotify_
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '"'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
IGNORE 1 LINES;
```

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM spotify_;
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT artist) FROM spotify_;
SELECT DISTINCT album_type FROM spotify_;
SELECT MAX(duration_min) FROM spotify_;
SELECT MIN(duration_min) FROM spotify_;
SELECT DISTINCT channel FROM spotify_;
SELECT * FROM spotify_ WHERE views < 1;
```

### 4. Data Cleaning
```sql
-- Temporarily Disable Safe Update Mode
SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 0;

-- Delete invalid records (duration has a value of 0)
DELETE FROM spotify_ WHERE duration_min = 0;

-- Updating the 'Most_Played_On' column
UPDATE spotify_ 
SET most_played_on = CONCAT(most_played_on, CHAR(13))
WHERE LENGTH(most_played_on) = 7;

-- Assigning the right value
UPDATE spotify_ 
SET licensed = IF(licensed = "true", 1, 0),
    official_video = IF(official_video = "true", 1, 0);
```

### 5. SQL Queries for Spotify Data Analysis
```sql
-- 1. Retrieve the names of all tracks that have more than 1 billion streams.
SELECT * FROM spotify_ WHERE stream > 1000000000;

-- 2. List all albums along with their respective artists.
SELECT DISTINCT album, artist FROM spotify_;

-- 3. List all tracks along with their views and likes where official_video = TRUE.
SELECT track, SUM(views), SUM(likes) FROM spotify_ 
WHERE official_video = "true" 
GROUP BY 1 
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

-- 4. Get the total number of comments for tracks where licensed = TRUE.
SELECT SUM(comments) AS TOTAL_COMMENTS FROM spotify_ WHERE licensed = "TRUE";

-- 5. For each album, calculate the total views of all associated tracks.
SELECT album, SUM(views) AS total_views
FROM spotify_
GROUP BY album
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

-- 6. Find all tracks that belong to the album type single.
SELECT * FROM spotify_ WHERE album_type = "single";

-- 7. Find the top 3 most-viewed tracks for each artist using window functions.
WITH ranking_artist AS (
    SELECT artist, track, SUM(views) AS total_view,
           DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY artist ORDER BY SUM(views) DESC) AS ranking  
    FROM spotify_
    GROUP BY artist, track
)
SELECT * FROM ranking_artist WHERE ranking <= 3;

-- 8. Count the total number of tracks by each artist.
SELECT artist, COUNT(*) AS no_of_tracks FROM spotify_ 
GROUP BY artist 
ORDER BY 2;

-- 9. Find artists with more than one album.
SELECT artist, COUNT(album) AS album_count FROM spotify_ 
GROUP BY 1
HAVING album_count > 1 
ORDER BY album_count; 

-- 10. Calculate the average danceability of tracks in each album.
SELECT album, AVG(danceability) FROM spotify_ 
GROUP BY album 
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

-- 11. Find the top 5 most popular tracks (based on likes) by artists with more than 1 million streams, 
-- where the danceability score is above 0.6 and the track is not an official video.
SELECT artist, track, album, danceability, likes, stream
FROM spotify_
WHERE stream > 1000000 AND danceability > 0.6 AND official_video = FALSE
ORDER BY likes DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- 12. Find the top 5 tracks with the highest energy values.
SELECT track, energy FROM spotify_ ORDER BY energy DESC LIMIT 5;

-- 13. Tracks with highest average views per stream.
SELECT track, 
       (SUM(views) / SUM(stream)) AS avg_views_per_stream
FROM spotify_
WHERE stream > 0  -- Avoid division by zero
GROUP BY track
ORDER BY avg_views_per_stream DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- 14. Find tracks where the liveness score is above the average.
SELECT artist, track, liveness 
FROM spotify_ 
WHERE liveness > (SELECT AVG(liveness) FROM spotify_);

-- 15. Use a WITH clause to calculate the difference between the highest and lowest energy values for tracks in each album.
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT album,
           MIN(energy) AS lowest_energy,
           MAX(energy) AS highest_energy
    FROM spotify_
    GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT album, 
       highest_energy - lowest_energy AS energy_difference
FROM cte
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

-- 16. Calculate the cumulative sum of likes for tracks ordered by the number of views, using window function.
SELECT track, artist, views, likes,
       SUM(likes) OVER (ORDER BY views) AS cumulative_likes
FROM spotify_
ORDER BY views;

-- 17. Find the Top 3 Artists by Total Likes.
SELECT artist, track, album, SUM(likes) AS total_likes
FROM spotify_
GROUP BY artist
ORDER BY total_likes DESC
LIMIT 3;

-- 18. Find the Top 3 Most Liked Tracks for Each Artist.
WITH ranked_artist AS (
    SELECT artist, track, likes,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY artist ORDER BY likes DESC) AS ranks
    FROM spotify_
)
SELECT * FROM ranked_artist WHERE ranks <= 3;
```

### 6. Index Creation and Query Optimization
```sql
-- Index Creation
CREATE INDEX idx_artist ON spotify_(artist);

-- Execute the Query Before Creating the Index
SELECT * FROM spotify_ WHERE artist = 'Gorillaz';

-- Execute the Same Query After Creating the Index
SELECT * FROM spotify_ WHERE artist = 'Gorillaz';
```

## Query Optimization Technique

To improve query performance, we carried out an optimization process focusing on indexing the artist column. This optimization significantly reduces query time, enhancing the overall performance of our database operations in the Spotify project.

### Initial Query Performance Analysis Using EXPLAIN

Before creating the index, we analyzed the performance of a query that retrieved tracks based on the artist column. The performance metrics were as follows:
- **Execution time (E.T.)**: 0.062 ms

#### EXPLAIN Results Before Index Creation
(![before_indexing](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de010985-d99b-4482-a5dd-3e809f747b0a)
) 

### Index Creation on the Artist Column

To optimize the query performance, we created an index on the artist column, which ensures faster retrieval of rows where the artist is queried. The SQL command for creating the index is as follows:
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_artist ON spotify_(artist);
```

### Performance Analysis After Index Creation

After creating the index, we ran the same query again and observed significant improvements in performance:
- **Execution time (E.T.)**: 0.000 ms

#### EXPLAIN Results After Index Creation
(![after_indexing](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6eb33d65-5538-4614-999a-012db8585d74)
